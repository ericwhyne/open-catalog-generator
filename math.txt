Development over the last two weeks:
 - From Github framework repo: 3 authors have pushed 24 commits to all branches, excluding merges. On master, 366 files have changed and there have been 16,739 additions and 17,064 deletions [1].
 - From Github data repo:  3 authors have pushed 28 commits to all branches, excluding merges. On master, 19 files have changed and there have been 553 additions and 433 deletions.

Internals:
 - Comprising the live version of the Open Catalog on darpa.mil there are 370 pages (in this case .html) and 2670 referenced files (mostly code stats pages and images)  [3].
 - For fun, I did some math on darpa.mil. It has 788 pages (not counting the 370 from the Open Catalog which would bring the total to 1158) and 3288 referenced files. Of the pages, 250 are NewsEvents press releases. Subtracting those: 538 pages aren't press releases. I have more metrics about file sizes, etc... interesting but not useful [3].
